             * it is the default for databases other than sql server.
             * 
             * DefaultSqlExecutionStrategy: this is an internal execution strategy that is used 
             * by default. This strategy does not retry at all, however, it will wrap any exceptions 
             * that could be transient to inform users that they might want to enable connection resiliency.
             * 
             * DbExecutionStrategy: this class is suitable as a base class for other execution strategies, 
             * including your own custom ones. It implements an exponential retry policy, 
             * where the initial retry happens with zero delay and the delay increases exponentially 
             * until the maximum retry count is hit. This class has an abstract ShouldRetryOn method 
             * that can be implemented in derived execution strategies to control which exceptions 
             * should be retried.
             * 
             * SqlAzureExecutionStrategy: this execution strategy inherits from DbExecutionStrategy 
             * and will retry on exceptions that are known to be possibly transient when working 
             * with SqlAzure.
